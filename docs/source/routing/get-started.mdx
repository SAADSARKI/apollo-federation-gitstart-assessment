Hello! Let's run Apollo Router for the very first time.

You will:

- Learn why the router is a graph's runtime.
- Download a router binary.
- Download a supergraph schema.
- Run the router for your supergraph in development mode.
- Make a query to the running router.

## Concept: Apollo Router is the graph runtime

Apollo Router is the graph runtime of Apollo. It receives client requests, intelligently orchestrates calls to the various APIs that make up a graph, then bundles the fetched data into a client response.

Because Apollo uses GraphQL and Apollo Federation to define a graph, each router is an endpoint of a GraphQL API. It's the gateway for all client requests to a federated graph, or "supergraph." Like API gateways in general, a router offers a central place to implement cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication, authorization, caching, logging, monitoring, rate limiting, and demand control. These and other features of the router are configurable declaratively via YAML.

You can deploy the router locally or at scale in containers on your own infrastructure. This guide walks you through the basics of running the router locally. 

## 1. Download and extract the router binary

Let's start by downloading a router binary.

1. Download and install the latest version of the router binary with a single command line:

    ```bash showLineNumbers=false
    curl -sSL https://router.apollo.dev/download/nix/latest | sh
    ```

    <ExpansionPanel title="Download a specific router version">

    To download and install a specific version of router, set the version in the download URL path.

    For example, to download router v2.0.0:

    ```bash showLineNumbers=false
    curl -sSL https://router.apollo.dev/download/nix/v2.0.0 | sh
    ```

    </ExpansionPanel>

    Optionally, go to [router releases](https://github.com/apollographql/router/releases) in GitHub to download and extract a bundle.

1. Check that your router installed successfully by running the `router` binary from your project's root directory:

    ```bash showLineNumbers=false
    ./router --version
    ```


## 2. Download a supergraph schema

A router needs a schema for the federated graph, or "supergraph", that it's orchestrating. For this guide, we're downloading an example supergraph schema, which we'll provide to the router when running it.

1. From your project's root directory, run the following to download and save a supergraph schema to a file:

  ```bash showLineNumbers=false
  curl -sSL https://supergraph.demo.starstuff.dev/ > supergraph-schema.graphql
  ```

## 3. Run the router

Running the router in development mode enables some useful development-only features. Let's now run the router in dev mode, using the supergraph schema you saved: 

1. Run the router with command-line options, which enable dev mode and provide a path to your supergraph schema:

    ```sh
    ./router --dev --supergraph supergraph-schema.graphql
    ```

1. Check that your router is running, with output similar to the example: 

    <ExpansionPanel title="Example router output">

    ```

## 4. Make a query

A router in dev mode runs its own [Apollo Sandbox](/graphos/explorer/sandbox/), a local GraphQL server running a development instance of your graph. Sandbox has a browser-based IDE, Explorer, that you can use to write and send real GraphQL queries to your development graph. 

Let's use Sandbox to write and send a query to your graph:

1. Open a browser and go to the URL of the router's Sandbox, `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.

1. Copy and paste the example query into the **Operation** pane:

  ```graphql
  query Query {
    recommendedProducts {
      inStock
      name
      price
      reviews {
        author {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

1. Click **Query** to run the query, then check its response in the **Response** pane.

  <img
    className="screenshot"
    alt="Apollo Sandbox IDE showing successful query and response at the end of the router quickstart"
    src="../images/router-quickstart-sandbox.jpg"
    width="700"
  />

That's it! You've successfully sent a query to a router running a development graph and received a response.
