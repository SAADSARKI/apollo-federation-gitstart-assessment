For enhanced security, the GraphOS Router can reject requests that violate any of the following kinds of limits:

- Operation-based semantic limits
- Network-based limits
- Parser-based lexical limits

```yaml title="router.yaml"
limits:
  # Network-based limits
  http_max_request_bytes: 2000000 # Default value: 2 MB
  http1_max_request_headers: 200 # Default value: 100
  http1_max_request_buf_size: 800kb # Default value: 400kib

  # Parser-based limits
  parser_max_tokens: 15000 # Default value
  parser_max_recursion: 500 # Default value

  # Operation-based limits (Enterprise only)
  max_depth: 100
  max_height: 200
  max_aliases: 30
  max_root_fields: 20
```
