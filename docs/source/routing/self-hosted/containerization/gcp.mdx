Learn how to deploy the router on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with Cloud Run.

## Prerequisites

### Router

1. Choose a version of the router to deploy (for example, `v1.61.0`).

### Docker 

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) locally.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

1. Create a new [Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com/) or go to an existing account.
1. Install the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install), if not already installed.
1. Create a new GCP project.
    1. Choose a project name (for example, `my-project`). Keep this name handy, as you'll need it later to build and run a router image.
1. Enable [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/enable-service) in your project.
    1. Create a repository and choose a repository name (for example, `my-repo`). Keep this name handy, as you'll need it later to build and deploy a router image.
1. (Recommended) In GCP Secret Manager, set `APOLLO_KEY` to your graph API key and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` to your graph ref. You'll need them later to deploy a router image. 

## Build and push router image

1. In a local directory, create a `router.yaml` file and copy-paste the following into the file: 
    
    ```yaml title="router.yaml"
    supergraph:
        listen: 0.0.0.0:4000
    health_check:
        listen: 0.0.0.0:8088
    ```

    Because the router's default HTTP and health check endpoint addresses are localhost and wouldn't be reachable when deployed, edit your `router.yaml` to configure these endpoints to listen to all addresses:  

1. Create a `Dockerfile` file and copy-paste the following into the file:

    ```text
    # Use the official Apollo Router Core image as the base.
    # Set the image tag to the desired router version (e.g. v1.61.0)
    FROM ghcr.io/apollographql/router:v1.61.0

    # Replace the default router config with the local, customized router.yaml
    COPY router.yaml /dist/config/router.yaml
    ```

1. From the same local directory, run the following `docker` CLI command to build a new router image. Choose a name and tag for the image, for example `router-gcp:v1.61.0`.
    
    ```bash
    docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64  -t router-gcp:v1.61.0 --load .
    ```

    - Because Cloud Run only supports AMD64-based images, the `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64` command ensures the image is built for AMD64 and is compatible.  
    - The `--load` option loads the built image to `docker images`.

1. Run `docker images` and validate that your router image was successfully built and loaded.

1. Run the following `docker` commands to tag and push the local router image to Artifact Registry:

```bash
docker tag router-gcp:v1.61.0 us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/router-gcp:v1.61.0
docker push us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/router-gcp:v1.61.0
```

1. In GCP console for your project, go to Artifact Registry and validate the router image has been successfully pushed.

## Configure and deploy router 

With the router image pushed to GCP, you can now configure and deploy it as a Cloud Run service.

You can use either Google Cloud console or gcloud CLI. In either case, you need to gather the following information:

* Name for your deployed router service (for example, `my-router`)
* GCP project name (for example, `my-project`)
* Artifact Registry repo name (for example, `my-repo`)
* GCP region (for example, `us-west2`)
* Full image path (for example, `us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/router-gcp:v1.61.0`) 
* `APOLLO_KEY` and `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` secrets

### Deploy with Google Cloud console

1. In GCP console for your project, go to Cloud Run and select **Deploy container** > **Service**.
1. On the **Create Service** page, update the following configurations:
    1. Set **Container image URL** to your tagged and pushed router image. 
    1. Set **Service name** to a name for your deployed router (for example, `my-router`).
    1. Set **Region** to your GCP region.
    1. Set **Authentication** to **Allow unauthenticated invocations**.
    1. On the **Container(s)** > **Edit Container** tab, update the following configurations:
        1. On the **Settings** tab:
            1. Set **Container port** to `4000`.
            1. Set **Container command** to `/dist/router`.
            1. (Optional) if running router in dev mode, set **Container arguments** to `--dev`.
        1. On the **Variables & Secrets** tab, add the following variables (either as environment variables or referenced secrets):
            1. Add `APOLLO_KEY` and set it to your graph API key.
            1. Add `APOLLO_GRAPH_REF` and set it to your graph ref.   

1. Click **Deploy** on the bottom-left of the console.

### Deploy with gcloud CLI

To deploy the router with the gcloud CLI, run the following commands, with your configuration info in place of the example info:

```bash 
gcloud run deploy my-router \
--image=us-west2-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/router-gcp:v1.61.0 \
--command=/dist/router \
--args=--dev \
--set-secrets=APOLLO_KEY=APOLLO_KEY:latest,APOLLO_GRAPH_REF=APOLLO_GRAPH_REF:latest \
--region=us-west2 \
--project=router-container-gcp \
 && gcloud run services update-traffic router-gcp --to-latest
```
