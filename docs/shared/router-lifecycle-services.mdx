A router's request lifecycle has three major services that support instrumentation:

* **Router service** - Handles the opaque bytes of an incoming HTTP request before it's parsed into a GraphQL request. Operates within an HTTP server.
* **Supergraph service** - Handles a GraphQL request after it has been parsed and before it is sent to subgraphs. Runs the query planner to produce a query plan to execute.
* **Subgraph service** - Handles GraphQL subgraph requests that have been executed as part of a query plan. Creates HTTP client requests to subgraphs.

<Note>

The router's **Execution service** that executes query plans doesn't support instrumentation.
